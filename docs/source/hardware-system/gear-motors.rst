    Typical DC Gear Motor

DC gear motors take electrical energy and convert it into spinning motion. The more power we deliver to a motor, the faster it spins. 

Our example car uses two independent DC gear motors to spin the rear wheels, making the car a two-wheel drive (2WD). If we provide equal power to both motors, then theoretically the car should move in a straight line. If we now reverse the direction of current on both motors, then the car should move in a straight line, but in the opposite direction.

    may need to attach image of an axle here to be more clear

What if we want to turn the car? Traditionally a car's front wheels are attached to an axle that controls the steering. However, our car doesn't have an axle. Instead, our front wheel is a freely-rotating castor wheel like those you find on office chairsâ€”so we can't use it to steer the car. Instead we can steer the car by supplying power to our rear wheels in unequal amounts. If we're moving the car in a straight line, we can reduce power to the left wheel and this will steer the car left.

    I think it would help to have the image of the bottom view of the car again here
